# ART Enterprises Desktop App

This project, undertaken during the first year of my degree three years ago, focused on the development of a desktop application tailored for the needs of a metal crusher company. The conventional method involved manual data entry from receipts into physical books, followed by labor-intensive processing for report generation. The primary objective of the application was to streamline this process by transitioning to a database-driven system, thereby reducing manual effort and facilitating efficient data management.

Specifically designed for the ART Enterprises (Pvt Ltd) company, the application features comprehensive functionalities, including user authentication, record management for customer purchases and order details, supplier information, inventory tracking of materials, as well as user and administrative roles. Leveraging SQL as the backend database, the application provides a robust platform for storing and retrieving data seamlessly.

Moreover, the application includes features for the creation and exporting of data into Excel and PDF formats, enabling users to generate detailed reports effortlessly. This functionality enhances the utility of the application by providing convenient options for data analysis and presentation.

This desktop application project stands as a testament to my early endeavors in software development, showcasing my ability to design and implement solutions that address real-world business challenges.
